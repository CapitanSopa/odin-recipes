    <p class="description">If there's one thing people seem to associate Deadpool with, it's chimichangas. Fun fact though: Deadpool doesn't actually care for chimichangas that much, he just really loves saying the word. </p>
    <p class="description">Even if Chimichangas aren't Deadpool's favorite food, all that fighting is sure to leave one hungry!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 F degrees.</li>
            <li> If using ground hamburger, brown your burger. If using raw chicken, cook and shred your chicken. If using rotisserie chicken add it to your sauce pan for heating.</li>
            <li> Add the corn, green chiles, taco seasoning, & enchilada sauce. Cook on medium heat for 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li> Stir in the shredded cheese & refried beans, then turn the heat off.</li>
            <li> Spoon your chimichanga mix into the soft shells (1/2 a cup of mix works well). Fold the top and bottom of the shell up, then roll closed and place the chimis seam side down in a baking pan.</li>
            <li> Coat the outside of your chimis with melted butter.</li>
            <li> Bake your chimichangas in the oven for 20 minutes, then flip them over. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until lightly brown and crisp.</li>
            <li> Serve right away with your favorite toppings.  </li>          
        </ol>
